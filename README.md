The simulated annealing algorithm with Adaptive temperature rising strategy or Monte Carlo strategy shows has the problems of slow convergence and limited global optimal approximation ability in solving complex TSP problems respectively; On the other hand, the existing chaotic optimization algorithm has the defect of logistic mapping, which weakens its ability to jump out of local optima. Therefore, a fusion algorithm framework is designed, in which the divided Lorenz chaotic  mapping system is embedded to enhance the search efficiency of the chaotic algorithm for the neighborhood solution; the greedy strategy is introduced to construct the initial solution approaching the global optimal solution, which makes the algorithm have the ability of " transition" to the neighborhood of the global optimal solution; in addition, the complementary mechanism of oscillatory annealing is designed to improve the sub iterative solution screening process, Enhance the global search performance of the algorithm. After the implementation of the algorithm, using the international public TSPLIB point set, through multiple rounds of comparative testing, it is verified that the performance of the new algorithm is better than the comparison group simulated annealing algorithm and logistic chaos optimization algorithm, and has shorter convergence time and stronger global optimal approximation ability.
